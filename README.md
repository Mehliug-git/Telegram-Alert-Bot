# Telegram Alert Bot

A Python bot that sends you on Telegram the emails you want to monitor.

For hosting I use [GLITCH](https://glitch.com/dashboard) (for simple and free host)
<br><br>
## How use it ?

Just clone the repo on your hosting server, Read the google documentation for the OAuth 2.0 connexion, make the step for the Token.json and Credentials.json files, Make a telegram bot with the BotFather
<br><br>
Now just make a loop for start the script (And go to the script for modify the trigger words in the `query =` )


This script can help you to see your security alert mail in a Telegram Bot for more reactivity
